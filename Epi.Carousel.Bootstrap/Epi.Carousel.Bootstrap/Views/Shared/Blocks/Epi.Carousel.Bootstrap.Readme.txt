You can easily add your own partial views for a single carousel slide for content types that implement Episerver's IContent interface.
Just add a view into this folder ("~/Views/Shared/Blocks/") and name it according to this pattern: "Carousel{TypeName}.cshtml".
So for instance if you have a content type "StandardPage" in your project, add a view "CarouselStandardPage.cshtml".
Check the file "~/Views/Shared/Blocks/CarouselSlideBlock.cshmtl" to see an example of the slide item view implementation.
